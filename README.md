# elevator-saga
These are my attempts at the [elevator saga game](http://play.elevatorsaga.com/).

This repo contains branches for each level of the elevator saga as I go through the levels. Once a level has been completed the branch will be merged into master.

# Using jQuery
It is not too obvious in the description of the game, but the site uses jQuery and thereofre the game allows you to use it too.
